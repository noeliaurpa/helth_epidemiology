This analysis applied clustering techniques to segment a population based on health-related variables such as age, smoking habits, and chronic diseases. During the process, it became evident that traditional visualizations did not clearly reveal group structures. Therefore, dimensionality reduction techniques like t-SNE and interactive 3D visualizations with Plotly were used. The K-Means algorithm was the most suitable model, successfully forming well-defined and interpretable clusters. The results showed patterns consistent with real-world trends, highlighting the potential of this type of analysis to support decision-making in areas such as public health and personalized medicine.

Task applied:
* Performed population segmentation using clustering techniques (K-Means) on a dataset with variables such as age, smoking status, and chronic diseases.
* Applied dimensionality reduction (t-SNE) to enhance cluster visualization and interpretation.
* Used interactive 3D visualizations (Plotly) to explore group behavior from multiple perspectives.
* Identified meaningful patterns aligned with real-world trends, highlighting the potential of clustering in public health and personalized medicine.
* Evaluated model performance using the elbow method and Silhouette Score.
